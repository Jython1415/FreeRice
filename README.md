# FreeRice JavaScript Bot
Learning JavaScript bot for freerice.com

Originally based on this 1-liner that only does multiplication:

(There's also more info on how to run it, etc. there if you need it.)

To use, paste the [**bot.js**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eholcom/FreeRice/master/bot.js) content into the browser's console (F12) and hit Enter.

It will mimic human behavior in that it will take a random amount of time to answer each question (~2-5 seconds) and sometimes longer.  There are parameters to set how long it will run or to collect a certain amount of rice before stopping. 

* Works with the following subjects (with pre-loaded answers): 
  * English Vocabulary (can quickly get up to the mid-20 levels),
  * Chemical Symbols (both), 
  * Multiplication table, 
  * Identify Countries on the Map
  * Flags of the world

* The following will work, but it will have to learn what's correct as it goes:
  * World Landmarks
  * Famous Paintings
