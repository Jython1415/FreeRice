# FreeRice JavaScript Bot

I MADE A CLONE OF THIS TO SEE HOW IT WORKED AND MAKE SOME MODIFICATIONS. IT WAS A WHILE AGO, SO I AM ARCHIVING THE REPOSITORY NOW. 2025-02-06.

Learning JavaScript bot for freerice.com

Originally based on this 1-liner that only does multiplication: 
  http://theedward.me/autorice-automatic-freerice-cheat-script/
(There's also more info on how to run it, etc. there if you need it.)

To use, paste the [**bot.js**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eholcom/FreeRice/master/bot.js) content into the browser's console (F12) and hit Enter.

It will mimic human behavior in that it will take a random amount of time to answer each question (4+ seconds).  There are parameters to set how long it will run or to collect a certain amount of rice before stopping. 

* Works with the following subjects (with pre-loaded answers): 
  * English Vocabulary (can quickly get up to the mid-20 levels),
  * Chemical Symbols (both), 
  * Multiplication table, 
  * Identify Countries on the Map
  * Flags of the world
  * World Landmarks
  * World Capitals

* The following will work, but it will have to learn what's correct as it goes:
  * Famous Paintings
  * Certain languages: Italian, French, Spanish, German

This is meant as an example/coding exercise only and should not be used to spam FreeRice.com with traffic or anything of that nature.  **And as a reminder, FreeRice.com works off ad revenue, so you should turn off your ad-blocker and/or click some ads from time to time as you're playing to help them pay the bills for all that rice!**
