# FreeRice JavaScript Bot
Learning JavaScript bot for freerice.com

To use, paste the _bot.js_ content into the browser's console (F12).  It will mimic human behavior in that it will take a random amount of time to answer each question (2-5 seconds) and sometimes much longer.  There are parameters to set how long it will run or to collect a certain amount of rice before stopping.

* Works with the following subjects (with pre-loaded answers): 
  * English Vocabulary (can quickly get up to the mid-20 levels),
  * Chemical Symbols (both), 
  * Multiplication table, 
  * Identify Countries on the Map 

* The following will work, but it will have to learn what's correct as it goes:
  * World Landmarks
  * Flags of the world
  * Famous Paintings
